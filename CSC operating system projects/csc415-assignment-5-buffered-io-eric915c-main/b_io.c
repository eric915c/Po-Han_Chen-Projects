* Project:: Assignment 5 â€“ Buffered I/O read
*
* File:: b_io.c
*
* Description:: This project involves creating efficient
* buffered I/O functions in C to read data from files. Through
* this assignment to learn how to optimize file reading, manage
* multiple files, and handle end-of-file situations correctly.
* Using low-level APIs and ensure that the buffered I/O
* operations are performed efficiently.
